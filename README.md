It could be an undiagnosed bug, issues with hardware acceleration on your PC, or broken extensions or Chrome settings causing the problem.

This error can happen at random, or it can be caused by specific things you do, such as opening a new tab or activating a new Chrome extension. Unfortunately, there isn’t an error code or log you can check to determine why your browser window is turning black, so diagnosing it can be tricky.
